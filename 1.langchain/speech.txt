Good morning, everyone.
Life often presents us with the same circumstances, but it's our perspective that determines the outcome. Think about three common items: a potato, an egg, and a coffee bean. All are subjected to the same boiling water, an intense challenge or adversity.
The potato starts off strong and hard, but the boiling water makes it soft and weak. It loses its form and substance.
The egg is fragile on the outside, but inside, the liquid interior hardens under the pressure and heat. It changes internally, becoming rigid and unyielding.
But the coffee bean is unique. When exposed to the boiling water, it changes the water itself, creating a rich, new brew.
